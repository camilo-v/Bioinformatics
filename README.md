Bioinformatics
============

This here repository contains a collection of software related to topics in Bioinformatics.


## How To Get Started

- [Download the Code](https://github.com/camilo-v/Bioinformatics/archive/master.zip) and follow the standard instructions on how to install the framework/library.

## Communication

- If you **find a bug**, open an issue and _please provide detailed steps to reliably reproduce it_.
- If you have **feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **would like to contribute**, please submit a pull request.

## Requirements

You will need a reasonably new computer with a decent amount of RAM; it should also contain runtimes for Python, Perl, R, Swift, Objective-C, and the Bash shell. Needless to say, you will need basic knowledge on how to run things from the command line.

The basic requirements for the genomic scripts and software are:

- [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml)
- [TopHat](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/manual.shtml)
- [CuffDiff](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/)
- [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about)

For Visualizations, the basic requirements are:

- [GGPlot](http://ggplot2.org)
- [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com)
- [Circos](http://circos.ca)
